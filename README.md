A prototype of a national dataset of local plan documents published by Local Planning Authorities.

The list of documents collected is available in the dataset [dataset/local-plan.csv](dataset/local-plan.csv).

The source list of documents collected is kept and maintained using the [local plans prototype](https://local-plans-prototype.herokuapp.com/) -- [source](https://github.com/digital-land/local-plans-prototype).

The [collection](collection) directory contains:

* [collection/log](collection/log) -- log entries by date/URL (sha256)
* [collection/resource](collection/resource) -- collected files by contents (sha256)
* [index.json](collection/index.json) -- an index into the collection, used to build our [catalog](https://digital-land.github.io/catalog/) and other pages.

# Updating the collection

We recommend working in [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) before installing the python dependencies:

    $ make init
    $ make
